Due to small sample sizes many of these demos do not show appreciable
gains with respect to increasing the number of cores. Therefore,
bumping up sample sizes substantially to take runs from 10-20 seconds
to 50-100 seconds in the hopes that the larger sample sizes will show
expected scaling benefits.

Note - conmode, cmstest, and qreg use actual datasets so these are restricted
unless we wish to go with fully simulated data.

npcdensls only uses 1000 observations but is dog slow so want to stay
with a sufficient number of observations

added command line args to makefiles so on the mac

make npconmode np=2

and on sharcnet

make -f makefile.sharcnet n=2
